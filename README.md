# autoWQP

A package for automated processing of electronic forms, designed
 to run as part of a scheduled task on a server.

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. Sensitive information and
development history have been removed but I have kept the underlying
infrastructure as a learning tool/reference/example. **This package is
not functional** because proprietary information has been removed.
Maybe someday I'll make this package function as a demo... someday...
